# Disertation_Project
An ev3 robot based system implementation with an attached camera controlled by laptop to be used in rescue missions.

The aim of the project was to build and develop a car robot controlled by a laptop and attached a web camera on it to sendme real images, I created design at the robot using an ev3 Lega Mindstorms kit and I used MobaXTerm windows application for connectivity between the robot and the laptop. Also, a Net Gear adaptop was necessary to achive the robot wifi connectivity. That was an opportunity for me to develop my programming skills (Python and Small Basic) and my operating system skills (Ev3dev Linux and Android). The project was done totally by me.
